%% Training
for i = 1:size(train_images,1)
    I = train_images(i,:); % get next training image from image matrix
    I = reshape(I, [imsize_x, imsize_y]); % form a matrix from row vector

    P = train_patterns(i,:); % get next label matrix
    P = reshape(P, [imsize_x, imsize_y]);

    % Convert all possible neighborhoods in image to columns (feature vectors)
    % B contains as many columns as the number of pixels in I. (This 
    % is achieved by adding zeros at the image margin.) im2col is
    % an image processing toolbox function.
    B = im2col(padarray(I, [1, 1], 0, 'both'), [3, 3], 'sliding');
    faceFeatsNew = B(:,logical(P(:)));

    faceFeats = [faceFeats faceFeatsNew];
    nonFaceFeats = [nonFaceFeats nonFaceFeatsNew];

% Features are required in transposed format

% Compute the required parameters for Minimum-Distance and Bayes Classifier
